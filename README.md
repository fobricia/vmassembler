# vmassembler - VMProtect 2 Virtual Instruction Assembler

vmassembler is a small C++ project which uses [flex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_(lexical_analyser_generator)) and [bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/) to parse `.vasm` files and assemble virtual instructions. The project inherits [vmprofiler](https://githacks.org/vmp2/vmprofiler) which is used to identify vm handler's, provide them with a name, immidate value size, and other meta data to aid in assembling virtual instructions.
